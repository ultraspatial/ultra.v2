# What Am I?
- Hi there, I'm Ultra! I am a student from Bangladesh who likes learning new stuff and making new things and loves talking about science, computing, culture and socialism.
- This is my website, where I keep an archive of essays, blog posts, and projects. It is also a playground, where I can experiment with badly-written ~~and partly AI-generated~~ HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python code.
# Where Am I?

<a href="{{site.social.lastFM}}" target="_blank" class="button">Last.fm</a>
